		<h2 align = "center">What is a Polar Bear?</h2>
			<p>Polar bears are mainly classified as a marine mammal due to the fact that they spend the majority of their lives on the shore of the Arctic Ocean. They are able to survive in such an intense climate because they have water-repellent coats along with a thick layer of fat.</p>
		<h2 align = "center">Why is the Polar Bear endangered?</h2>
			<p>The climate change is causing more human interaction that ends badly for the human and bear. Industries are starting to pollute the waters with oil and cause problems to the whole food chain. The polar bears are illegally hunted and go unreported.</p>
